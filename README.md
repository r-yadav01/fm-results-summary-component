# Frontend Mentor - Results summary component solution

This is a solution to the [Results summary component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/results-summary-component-CE_K6s0maV). I build it using css, html. I have not used js to dynamically populate the content using the provided data.json file yet.

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I tinkered with `linear-gradient()` to get a feel how it works, how it is an `<image>` data-type in css, so to use it I have to use `background-image` css property instead of `background-color`.

### Continued development

I will complete the **bonus** part of the challenge, which is to use the provided `data.json` file to populate data dynamically.
